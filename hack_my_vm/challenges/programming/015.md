# Method of Solve
- Go to the challenge URL and read the programming description carefully it says to perform certain push operations
- So now lets decode the hex that is being pushed into UTF-8 readable characters
  ```
    hex_datas = ["7d616579","74696874","726f7773","696d7361","7b766d68"]

    print("".join(hex_datas[::-1]))
    res = []
    for hex_data in hex_datas:
        print(hex_data, end="-->")
        hex_string = hex_data
        decoded_text = bytes.fromhex(hex_string).decode("utf-8")[::-1]
        print(decoded_text)
        res.append(decoded_text)
    res.reverse()
    print("".join(res))
  ```
- This is the python script that can convert the The hex encoded text into utf-8 readable characters
- The output is :
  ```
    7b766d68696d7361726f7773746968747d616579
    7d616579-->yea}
    74696874-->thit
    726f7773-->swor
    696d7361-->asmi
    7b766d68-->hmv{
    hmv{asmisworthityea}
  ```
- The flag is **HMV{asmisworthityea}**
