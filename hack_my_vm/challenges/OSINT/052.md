# Concept 
To do some hardcore OSINT using just the satellite image of airport and timestamp

# Method of Solve
- Go to the Challenge Website and download the zip file
- Extract it and Open the image
- Read the txt file and decrypt the first paragraph ... its base64
  ```
    RCdgQV4/XVxJO3tGV1Z3UzRRdHIwYG9vSmw3WiInRERCQkFSYWFfdSl5W1p2b3RtM3FTaS9tbGVNaWhhJ2VeY1wiIV9eQFxbVFN3VzlPTk1McEpPSGxGS0RDZypAZD49QjtAPzhcNjU0WDgxNjU0MyxQKilNbm0lSUg1
    output to base64: D'`A^?]\I;{FWVwS4Qtr0`ooJl7Z"'DDBBARaa_u)y[Zvotm3qSi/mleMiha'e^c\"!_^@\[TSwW9ONMLpJOHlFKDCg*@d>=B;@?8\654X816543,P*)Mnm%IH5
  ```
- Now for the 2nd paragraph decrypt it ... it is base85 encoded
  ```
    6tmc`F^ZgDA8*0&i%-!lFWbX7EZf1:+ELt4F)N1CATVs2%178mA8*/sASl@'+Cf>1DKU&8+Cf>-+D5_'DBNP&EdD:J%16TYAKYf'+C\c$FD5<(+CfG7A7]RoASuU$+Co1/Eb0?5D_;
    output to base85:
      Di qua, di là, su per lo sasso tetro
      vidi demon cornuti con gran ferze,
      che li battien crudelmente di retro.
  ```
- Translate it and it gives
  ```
    Here and there, up the gloomy rock,
    I saw horned demons with large whips,
    who were cruelly beating them from behind.
  ```
- These are lines from Dante Alighieri's Inferno, specifically Canto XVIII (the 18th Canto of the Divine Comedy) and the context is :
  ```
    Dante and Virgil are in the Eighth Circle of Hell, specifically the first pouch of Malebolge (the "evil ditches"), where the panders and seducers are punished.
  ```
- It was hinting to go to the **https://malbolge.doleczek.pl/** to enter the code we got for the 1st paragraph
  ```
    It revealed a timestamp on running :
        10:11:2023:14:00
  ```
- So now we have a basic idea that it is related to an airport as it is a satellite view of some airport and after some OSINT I found out it belongs to **Netherland** named **Eindhoven Airport (EIN), Luchthavenweg, Eindhoven, Netherlands**
- So now we have to perform a check on the **https://globe.adsbexchange.com/** for the past replay of the flights on that day and time
- finally I got the details about the flight **Porto-OPO-Eindhoven-EIN-FR7472**
- So the flag is **HMV{Porto-OPO-Eindhoven-EIN-FR7472}**
