# Concept
Analyze pcapng file in wireshark to demonstrates a simple method for extracting files and other objects contained in packets of known protocols (e.g. HTTP, FTP, etc.)

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from Challenge interface
- Open the file in wireshark for analysis
- Loook for the *POST / upload.html HTTP/1.1 (PNG)* packet, this packet contains the png file that was uploaded to the server
- Now go to Content-Type: image/png in the request packet and copy the hex encoded image data as hex stream
- go to **cyberchef.io** and add from hex
- give input as the hex encoded image data
- save the output as **file_name.png** (as magic bits were representing png mime type)
- Open the png image and read the flag
- The Flag is **flag{3XtR4cT1n6_Fl4g5_L1k3_a_B0$$}**
