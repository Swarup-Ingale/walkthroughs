# Concept
Analyze the pcapng file in wireshark and extract the **Bytes of give Packet**

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from Challenge interface
- Open the file in wireshark and apply filter for given information in challenge i.e. **Source IP = 192.168.100.1** and **Destination IP = 192.168.100.2** for **Protocol = tcp**
- So the filter is : **"tcp && ip.src == 192.168.100.1 && ip.dst == "192.168.100.2**
- Now look for the packet or frame with data to be transmitted and ignore the SYN ACK FIN-ACK and ACK frames as they dont have the data we need
- Now go to the **Transmission Control Protocol** in the frame then go to **TCP Payload**
- copy the TCP Payload as **Hex Stream**
- Analyze the hex, we will realise that **1f 8b → GZIP magic bytes and 08 → compression method = DEFLATE**
- So we have to decompress it from hex using **gunzip**
- We will use **cyberchef.io** for this
- Go to cyberchef.io then add **from hex** and then add **gunzip** for decompression
- look for the flag in the output
- THe Flag is **flag{Byt35_Ex7rAct10n_1s_3a5y!}**
