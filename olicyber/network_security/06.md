# Concept
Analyze pcapng file in wireshark to apply various complex expression filters to filter out packets that contains flag (here **comment "Pwn all the things!!!"**)

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from the Challenge interface
- Open it in wireshark and start the analysis
- apply filter as **frame contains "Pwn all the things!!!"**
- decode the hex value to text (ascii)
- The hex is **50776e20616c6c20746865207468696e67732121212074686520666c34672069733a204c3361526e314e395f34623075545f46316c746572355f46316e645f54683073335f537472316e36355f6d380a**
- The ascii is **"Pwn all the things!!! the fl4g is: L3aRn1N9_4b0uT_F1lter5_F1nd_Th0s3_Str1n65_m8"**
- So the final flag is **flag{L3aRn1N9_4b0uT_F1lter5_F1nd_Th0s3_Str1n65_m8}**
