# Concept
Analyze pcapng file in wireshark using logical expressions to filter out multiple parameters together

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from the challenge interface
- open the file in wireshark
- apply the filter, here we have to apply multiple filters together as an expression : Source IP and Protocol
- we use filter expression as **ip.src == 192.168.100.3 && dns**
- we check for names in query in the filtered packet or frame
- the flag is **flag{L3aRn1N9_4b0uT_F1lter5_1P_DN5_f1lt3r}**
