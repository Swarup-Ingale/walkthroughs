- Open the pcapng file in wireshark to analyze it
- go to edit -> preferences -> protocols -> TLS
- Then load the tls-keys.txt in the input field named **(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename**
- apply the changes and click ok
- Look for the http request *GET.https://olicyber.it/* this request will have certain fields such as headers, vlaues, etc
