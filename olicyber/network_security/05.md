# Concept
Analyze pcapng file in wireshark by applying complex filter operations and expresions to search for only required packets (here **comments**)

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from the Challenge interface
- Open the file in wireshark
- look for comments in the **packet comments** for each and every packet
- As these comments are stored in metadata of the packets, they cannot be filtered and hence has to be checked manually
- look the one packet with packet comment (here **icmpv6 packet with arrival packet no. 232**)
- Read the packet comment and get the flag hidden in it
- The flag is **flag{L3aRn1N9_4b0uT_F1lter5_C0mm3Nt5_4R3_H4rd_t0_f1nD}**
