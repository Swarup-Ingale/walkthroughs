# Concept
Analyze pcapng file in wireshark to focus on conversations of TCP (TCP Streams)

# Method of Solve
- Download the pcapng file from the Challenge interface
- Open it in wireshark and analyze it
- Apply filter as **tcp** to display only tcp packets
- look for all the tcp packets as the data for flag is divided into multiple packets in a discrete manner
- The flag is **flag{F0lloW_7h3_Wh1t3_5tr3aM_4l1c3}**
