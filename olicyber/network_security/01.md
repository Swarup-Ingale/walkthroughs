Analysis of pcap files using wireshark

# Method of Solve

- first download the provided pcap file
- Open it in wireshark and perform analysis of the file
- Look fir the hex encoded ascii for the flag
- here for me the hex was **666c61677b5930755f6b6e30775f576834745f615f506334705f31737d0a**
- Decode the ascii using hex decoders or other tools used for decoding
- Get the Flag.
- the Flag is **flag{Y0u_kn0w_Wh4t_a_Pc4p_1s}**
