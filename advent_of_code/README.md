# 🎄 Advent of Code (2015–2025)

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code** challenges.

Advent of Code is an annual programming event that runs every December, featuring daily algorithmic and logic-based problems that progressively increase in difficulty. This repo serves as both a **learning log** and a **long-term challenge** to solve *every Advent of Code problem ever released*.

---

## 📌 Goals of This Repository

- ✅ Solve **all Advent of Code challenges from 2015 to 2025**
- ✅ Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- ✅ Practice clean, readable, and efficient code
- ✅ Explore different approaches and optimizations
- ✅ Maintain a well-organized archive of solutions

---

Each day typically includes:
- Solution code
- Input file (when applicable)
- Optional explanation or notes

---

## 🧠 Languages Used

Solutions may be implemented in one or more of the following languages:

- 🐍 Python (primary)
- 💻 C / C++
- ☕ Java (if required)
- 🧪 Other languages for experimentation

The chosen language for each problem depends on:
- Problem complexity
- Performance requirements
- Learning objectives
